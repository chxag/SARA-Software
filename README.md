# SARA-Software

Info on how to run the current branch:

1. Run `pgm_to_png_autocrop.py`; change the directories to match the Maps subdirectory
2. Run `load_map_grid.py` to view how we have coloured the grid
3. Run `recreate_grid.py` to visualise how the json file created could work when we implement it to the app.
